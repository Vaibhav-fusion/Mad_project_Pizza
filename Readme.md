## 📝 Problem Statement
Ordering pizza online is common, but many apps do not provide **full customization** or **real-time order tracking**.  
Small pizza outlets also struggle to manage orders and menus efficiently without a dedicated app.  

This project aims to provide an **easy-to-use platform** for customers to customize and order pizzas and for admins to manage menu items and orders in real time.

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution
A **cross-platform mobile application** built with **React Native** that allows:

- Users to **choose pizzas, customize toppings, select sizes, add to cart, checkout, and track orders**.
- Admins to **add/edit/delete pizzas, manage toppings, and update order statuses**.

The app will use **Firebase** for **data storage**, **authentication**, and **real-time synchronization**.

## 🚀 Key Features
